        <h2>Our Story: Why MMIW Matters</h2>
        <p>
          The MMIW crisis isn’t just a headline — it’s something many of us in Indigenous communities live with every day.
          We’ve lost mothers, daughters, sisters, aunties, and friends. And too often, their stories go unheard, their
          cases ignored, and their families left without answers.
        </p>
        <p>
          This movement — Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women — began because we were tired of being invisible. We were
          tired of calling for help and getting silence in return. For generations, our people have faced violence brought
          on by colonization, broken treaties, and systems that were never built to protect us. And through it all,
          Indigenous women have continued to fight — for ourselves, for our loved ones, for justice.
        </p>
        <p>
          The red handprint you see in our symbols isn’t just art. It’s the silencing of our voices. It’s the cry for help
          that too many never hear. And the color red — it’s what our ancestors say the spirits see. It’s how we call them
          home.

          This site is a space to remember, to honor, and to speak their names. It’s for the stories that were stolen and
          the ones we still carry. We’re still here. And we won’t stop telling the truth.
